### Fit the SIR Model to the COVID-19 data of the West Midlands, UK
The COVID-19 data of the region, West Midlands, is fit to the SIR Model to make appropriate predictions in concern to the pandemic using two methods, the method of the averages and curve-fitting. The results on applying both the methods are demonstrated. The graph generated by applying the method of averages is the graph in Figure_1.png while the graph generated by applying the curve-fit is the graph in Figure_2.png.
